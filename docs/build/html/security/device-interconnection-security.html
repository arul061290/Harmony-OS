<p>To transmit user data securely between devices, ensure that the devices
are trusted by each other. A trust relationship and a secure data
transmission channel must be established between the devices. The
following figure shows how an IoT controller and an IoT device establish
a trust relationship.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 1</strong> How an IoT controller and an IoT device establish a trust
relationship</p>
<p><img alt="image1" src="../_images/en-us_image_0000001052225646.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>IoT device interconnection security</strong></p>
<p>A trust relationship can be established between an IoT device that
runs OpenHarmony (such as an AI speaker, smart home device, and
wearable) and an IoT controller. Encrypted user data is transmitted
between the IoT device and IoT controller through a secure
connection.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>IoT service identifier of the IoT controller</strong></p>
<p>An IoT controller generates different identifiers for different IoT
device management services to isolate these services. The identifier
can be used for authentication and communication between an IoT
controller and an IoT device. It is an Ed25519 public/private key
pair generated using the elliptic curve cryptography.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>IoT device identifier</strong></p>
<p>An IoT device can generate its own device identifier for
communicating with the IoT controller. It is also an Ed25519
public/private key pair generated using elliptic curve cryptography,
with the private key stored on the IoT device. Each time the device
is restored to factory settings, the public/private key pair will be
reset.</p>
<p>The identifier can be used for secure communication between the IoT
controller and IoT device. After the devices exchange the service
identifier or device identifier, they can negotiate the key and
establish a secure communication channel.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>P2P trusted binding between devices</strong></p>
<p>When an IoT controller and an IOT device establish a trust
relationship, they exchange identifiers.</p>
<p>During this process, the user needs to enter or scan the PIN provided
by the IoT device on the IoT controller. PIN is either dynamically
generated if the IoT device has a screen, or preset by the
manufacturer if it does not have a screen. A PIN can be a number or a
QR code. Then the IoT controller and IoT device perform
authentication and session key exchange based on password
authenticated key exchange (PAKE), and use the session key to encrypt
the channel for exchanging identity public keys.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Secure communication between the IoT controller and IoT device</strong></p>
<p>When an IoT controller and an IoT device communicate with each other
after establishing a trust relationship, they authenticate each other
by using the locally stored identity public key of the peer.
Bidirectional identity authentication and session key exchange are
performed using the Station-to-Station (STS) protocol during each
communication. The session key is used to encrypt the data
transmission channel between the devices.</p>
