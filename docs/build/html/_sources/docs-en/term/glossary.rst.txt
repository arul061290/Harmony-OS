A
-

-  **Ability**

   An ability is an abstraction of a functionality that an application
   can provide. Abilities of applications are classified into two types:
   Feature Ability (FA) and Particle Ability (PA).

-  **AbilityForm**

   An AbilityForm displays brief information about a Feature Ability on
   the UI of another application and provides basic interactive
   features.

-  **AbilitySlice**

   An AbilitySlice is the combination of a single visualized UI and its
   interactive logic. AbilitySlice is the fundamental unit of a Feature
   Ability. A Feature Ability can contain a group of UIs representing
   closely associated services, and each UI corresponds to one
   AbilitySlice.

-  **ACE**

   Ability Crossplatform Environment, an environment for abilities to
   run across platforms

-  **AMS**

   Ability Manager Service, a service that manages abilities

B
-

-  **BMS**

   Bundle Manager Service, a service that manages application bundles

D
-

-  **DevEco Studio for Embedded**

   Integrated development environment (IDE) for developing embedded
   devices

-  **DMS**

   Distributed Manager Service, a service used for distributed data
   management

-  **DV**

   Device Virtualization, which employs the virtualization technology to
   integrate capabilities and resources of different devices

F
-

-  **FA**

   Feature Ability, representing an ability with a UI for interacting
   with users

H
-

-  **HAP**

   HarmonyOS Ability Package, released as a HAP file. One HAP file
   describes all content of an application, including code, resources,
   third-party libraries, and a configuration file.

-  **HCS**

   HDF Configuration Source (HCS) describes the HDF configuration using
   key-value pairs. HCS is designed to decouple configuration code from
   driver code, thereby facilitating configuration management.

-  **HC-GEN**

   HDF Configuration Generator (HC-GEN) is a tool used to convert the
   configuration text into the target. In the HarmonyOS kernel, it can
   convert the configuration file into the configuration tree of C
   programming source code. The driver then directly invokes the C
   programming code to obtain the configuration.

-  **HDF**

   HarmonyOS Driver Foundation that allows unified access from
   peripheral devices and provides foundation for driver development and
   management in HarmonyOS

I
-

-  **IDN**

   Intelligent Distributed Networking, a distributed networking
   capability unit specific to HarmonyOS. You can use IDN to obtain the
   device list and subscribe to the connection state changes of devices
   on the distributed network.

M
-

-  **MSDP**

   Mobile Sensing Development Platform, which provides the capabilities
   of distributed convergence sensing and distributed device
   virtualization.

   -  Distributed convergence sensing: Backed by the distributed
      capabilities of HarmonyOS, the MSDP integrates the sensing sources
      of all involved devices to accurately sense usersâ€™ space status,
      motion status, gestures, and health status. It thereby builds
      ubiquitous basic sensing capabilities, bringing smart life
      experience to users.
   -  Distributed device virtualization: Backed by the distributed
      capabilities of HarmonyOS, the MSDP virtualizes various components
      (such as cameras, monitors, speakers, and microphones) of
      peripherals into the components available for local devices. Also,
      it enables local devices to share their components with other
      devices.

P
-

-  **PA**

   Particle Ability, representing an ability without a UI. PAs are
   invoked to implement Feature Ability (FA) functionalities. For
   example, a PA runs in the background to provide the computing
   capability or acts as a data warehouse to provide the data access
   capability.

S
-

-  **SA**

   System Ability. The system abilities include the basic hardware and
   software services provided by the OS.

-  **Super virtual device**

   Also called super device. It integrates the capabilities of multiple
   devices through the distributed technology into a virtual hardware
   resource pool and then centrally manages and schedules these
   capabilities based on application requirements.
