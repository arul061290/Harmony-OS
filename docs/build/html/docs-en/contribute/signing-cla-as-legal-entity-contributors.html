<h1>Signing CLA as Legal Entity Contributors<a class="headerlink" href="#signing-cla-as-legal-entity-contributors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>By signing this Agreement For Contribution (this Agreement), the
undersigned Contributor agrees to accept and be legally bound by this
Agreement. This Agreement applies to the Contribution submitted by
Contributor to all the projects of OpenHarmony Community (“Project”),
whether provided before, on or after the signing date.</p>
<p><strong>Contribution</strong> shall mean any work protectable under copyright lawthat
is intentionally submitted by Contributor for inclusion in the software
distributed by the Project. “submitted” means any form of electronic,
verbal, or written communication sent to the hoster of the OpenHarmony
Community (Hoster, i.e. OPENATOM FOUNDATION) or its representatives,
including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists,
source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed
by, or on behalf of, the Hoster for the purpose of discussing and
improving the Project, but excluding communication that is conspicuously
marked or otherwise designated in writing by Me as “Not a Contribution.”</p>
<p><strong>Contributor or I or Me or My</strong> shall mean the individual or legal
entity identified in the signature block below. For legal entity, the
entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are
controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are
considered to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this
definition, ‘control’ means direct or indirect ownership of at least
fifty percent (50%) of the voting power, capital or other securities of
controlled or commonly controlled entity.</p>
<p>Each Contributor hereby grants to the Hoster and the recipients of
software distributed by the Project a perpetual, worldwide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive, irrevocable, sub-licensable copyright
license to reproduce, use, modify, or distribute its Contribution, with
modification or not.</p>
<p>Each Contributor hereby grants to the Hoster and recipients of the
software distributed by the Project a perpetual, worldwide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive, irrevocable patent license to make, have
made, use, offer for sale, sell, import or otherwise transfer its
Contribution where such patent license is only limited to the patent
claims owned or controlled by such Contributor now or in future which
will be necessarily infringed by its Contribution alone, or by
combination of the Contribution with the Project software to which the
Contribution was contributed, excluding of any patent claims solely be
infringed by your or others’ modification or other combinations. In case
the license adopted by the specific software distributed by the Project
has further restriction on the patent license granted to the software
recipients, for example, restricts the recipients to file patent
litigation or enforcement against Contribution or such software, then
the patent license to the recipients of the specific Project license
prevails.</p>
<p>Contributor represents that I’m the copyright owner of the Contribution
or I’m authorized by the copyright owner to make such Contribution, and
I’m legally entitled to grant the rights set out in this Agreement and
the License;</p>
<p>Contributor represents that I’m not aware any of My Contribution has
infringed or will infringe any third party’s copyrights, trademarks,
patents, or other intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>Except as otherwise stated in the Agreement, Contribution is provided
without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. In no event
shall any Contributor or copyright holder be liable to you for any
damages, including, but not limited to any direct, or indirect, special
or consequential damages arising from your use or inability to use the
software or the Contribution in it, no matter how it’s caused or based
on which legal theory, even if advised of the possibility of such
damages.</p>
<p>Please select one applicable statement from the following and fill in
the blanks.</p>
