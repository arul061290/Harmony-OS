<p>OpenHarmony is an open OS that allows you to easily develop services and
applications. It provides an execution environment to ensure security of
application data and user data.</p>
<p>This environment combines chip security and system security features
with upper-layer security services to secure hardware, the system, data,
device interconnection, applications, and updates.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Boot root of trust</p>
<p>OpenHarmony devices use the public key infrastructure (PKI) to
protect software integrity and ensure that the software source is
valid and the software is not tampered with.</p>
<p>In the device boot process, software signature verification is
performed at each phase to form a secure boot chain. If signature
verification fails at any phase, the device boot will be terminated.
The hardware or software entity that initially performs signature
verification in the secure boot chain is the boot root of trust. It
must be valid and should not be tampered with. The boot root of trust
can be a built-in code segment in the read-only memory (ROM). This
code segment is written in the chip during the chip manufacturing and
cannot be modified later. When the device is powered on and
initialized, this code segment is executed first and used to verify
software signatures.</p>
<p>When you use the code for signature verification, ensure the validity
of the PKI public keys. OpenHarmony devices use a storage medium such
as eFUSE and one-time password (OTP) to store the public keys (for
example, their hash values) and guarantee their validity. A public
key is usually programed into the eFuse or OTP of a device during
device manufacturing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Hardware-isolated trusted environment</p>
<p>The hardware-isolated trusted environment complies with the design
concept of the trusted computing system. There is a clear boundary
between the trusted environment and untrusted one. OpenHarmony
devices protect core sensitive data in the trusted environment. Even
if OS vulnerabilities in the untrusted environment are exploited,
sensitive data in the trusted environment is secure.</p>
<p>The trusted environment of OpenHarmony devices is built based on a
hardware security isolation mechanism. The chip isolation mechanism
varies slightly on different OpenHarmony devices, and the most common
mechanism is Arm TrustZone. On some RISC-V chip platforms,
independent security cores may also be used to build a trusted
environment.</p>
<p>A specific, simplified OS iTrustee lite runs in the trusted
environment to manage resources and schedule tasks in the environment
and provide security services for OpenHarmony devices. Key management
and data security are the most common security services in the
trusted environment. A device has a unique hardware root key in the
eFuse/OTP. Based on this root key and service context, the trusted
environment generates multiple keys that provide key management and
data encryption/decryption services for applications. During their
whole lifecycle, core keys of devices stay in the trusted
environment. The trusted environment also provides security services
such as identity authentication, system status monitoring, and secure
data storage to enhance device security.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Hardware key engine</p>
<p>Cryptography is the basis of information security. Data
encryption/decryption requires high efficiency and security of
computing devices. Hardware encryption/decryption technologies use
computer hardware to assist or even replace software to encrypt or
decrypt data. Hardware-based encryption/decryption is more efficient
and secure than software-based encryption/decryption.</p>
<p>Since some dedicated hardware resources are used for data
encryption/decryption, the CPU can concurrently execute other
computing tasks, which greatly improves performance and reduces the
CPU load. In addition, a well-designed hardware key engine protects
keys from leak even if the software is cracked and even defends
against electromagnetic and radiation attacks from physical channels.</p>
<p>OpenHarmony devices support the hardware key engine, which allows
OpenHarmony to perform computing tasks such as data encryption and
decryption, certificate signature verification, and hash value
calculation. The hardware key engine supports popular algorithms such
as Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Rivest-Shamir-Adleman
(RSA).</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Recommended Practices<a class="headerlink" href="#recommended-practices" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><p>The boot root of trust consists of a built-in code segment in the
chip and the root key of the device. The root of trust is written
into the chip during manufacturing and cannot be modified in the
device lifecycle. It is used to verify software certificates in the
device boot process. The root key is the public key matching the
private key of the device certificate signature. The private key is
maintained on the PKI signature server and the public key is written
to the device. To prevent attackers from tampering with the public
key to bypass signature authentication, you can write the public key
to media such as fuses on OpenHarmony devices. Considering that the
fuse space is limited, you can store only the hash value of the
public key in the fuse and verify the validity of the public key
using the boot code.</p></li>
<li><p>Generally, a trusted execution environment (TEE) is built based on
the Arm TrustZone technology, and can also adopt other isolation
mechanisms, such as TrustZone-M and independent security cores,
depending on the device form. A TEE OS must be deployed in the TEE to
manage resources and schedule tasks. OpenHarmony provides iTrustee as
the TEE OS. You can develop and deploy security services based on
iTrustee.</p>
<p>Not all OpenHarmony devices need to support the TEE, for example,
some devices with thin resources that run less sensitive services may
not need the TEE. You can choose whether to support the TEE and how
to implement the TEE based on service requirements.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The hardware key engine must provide key algorithms related to true
random numbers, public keys, symmetric keys, and hash values. By
deploying required drivers in OpenHarmony, you can provide unified
key management and key algorithms for applications.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For device with 128 KB to 128 MB of memory, the HarmonyOS lite kernel is
recommended.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Process isolation</p>
<p>Process isolation prevents processes from reading and writing memory
data of each other. Generally, virtual address space mapping is used
for process isolation. The virtual addresses of two processes are
mapped to physical address segments using the memory management unit
(MMU). In this way, the non-shared memory data that can be accessed
by one of the two processes through the virtual address is
inaccessible to the other process.</p>
<p>Due to limited resources, OpenHarmony adopts different mechanisms for
kernel-level and user-level processes. All kernel-level processes
share the same VMM space, that is, kernel-level processes are not
isolated from each other. When the OS is booted, two basic
kernel-level processes KProcess and KIdle are created. KProcess is
the root process of kernel-level process, and KIdle is the subprocess
of KProcess. Each user-level process has its own VMM space that is
invisible to other processes, and user-level processes are isolated
from each other.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Discretionary access control</p>
<p>Discretionary access control (DAC) means that the file owner
determines access permissions of other roles. There are three
granularities of permission control: user, group, and other (UGO).
The file owner can classify any user into one of the three dimensions
and adopt a control policy to perform DAC permission verification.</p>
<p>DAC depends on the attributes of processes, such as the UID and GID,
which are used as feature IDs during file creation and access. When
creating a file, the creator writes its UID into the file. When a
file is accessed, the UID is used for classifying the file.</p>
<p>Each application has a UID. When creating a file, an application adds
its UID to the metadata of the file and sets permissions of the user,
group, and other. When an application tries to access the file, the
UID and permissions in the metadata of the file are used to verify
the application UID.</p>
<p>The following figure shows how DAC works when a process accesses a
file. The DAC first matches the process UID with the file UID, and
then the process GID with the file GID. If the UID and GID both fail
to match, DAC checks the <strong>other</strong> attribute of the file to determine
whether the process is allowed to read, write, or execute the file.
In addition, the system supports a privileged capability that is not
subject to DAC mechanism (read, write, and execute) and can access
files directly. Services with high permissions (such as system
services) can manage files of applications with low permissions (such
as third-party applications).</p>
<p><strong>Figure 2</strong> How DAC works</p>
<p><img alt="image2" src="../_images/en-us_image_0000001055079849.png" /></p>
</li>
<li><p>Capability mechanism</p>
<p>The capability mechanism is a subdivision of the root permission. A
multi-user computer system usually has a special role that has all
system permissions, that is, the system administrator with the root
permission. OpenHarmony needs to support kernels of the third-party
application ecosystem, and privileged access to the system must be
controlled. The system needs to restrict privileged system calls made
by users to access the kernel. Only some applications with high-level
permissions are allowed to perform privileged operations. To be
specific, the kernel spawns the first user program INIT that has all
privileged permissions. Then INIT starts other application framework
services and retains only privileged permissions necessary for each
application. When an application requests to call a privileged API,
the kernel checks whether the application has the permission to
access the API based on the process ID.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Secure boot</p>
<p>Secure boot is the basis of system security. A digital signature and
integrity verification mechanism is used to verify the integrity and
validity of software at each layer, starting from the boot root of
trust in the chip. This ensures that a correct and valid OS is
booted, preventing attackers from tampering with or implanting system
software and providing a secure, basic running environment.</p>
<p>The chip does not need to be verified after it is powered on because
the on-chip ROM code cannot be modified. The on-chip ROM verifies the
bootloader based on the public key hash value which is calculated
using the asymmetric algorithm in eFuse. The verification is
performed based on the hardware trust root and is fully trusted. The
bootloader that passes this verification is deemed to be trusted for
subsequent use. This is the process of constructing a trust chain.
Bootloader initializes the execution environment, including
initializing the double data rate (DDR) and reading and writing the
flash memory, to prepare for loading modules and executing more
complex logic. After the bootloader is initialized, it verifies the
integrity of the X.509 certificate and verifies image packages
(<strong>kernel.bin</strong>, <strong>teeOS.bin</strong>, and <strong>rootfs.bin</strong>) using the public
key of the X.509 certificate.</p>

upgrade.</p></li>

<p>Huawei Universal Keystore Service (HUKS) provides certificate
management, key management, secure storage, and key authentication
services. For OpenHarmony, it mainly provides key management and secure
storage, as well as the basic device certification feature for HiChain
(device certification platform). The following figure shows the
functions of HUKS</p>
<p><strong>Figure 3</strong> HUKS functions</p>
<p><img alt="image3" src="../_images/en-us_image_0000001054599869.png" /></p>
<p>The following algorithms are supported:</p>
<p>Authentication and encryption: AES-128/192/256-GCM</p>
<p>Signature verification: ED25519</p>
<p>Key negotiation: X25519</p>
<p>Message authentication: HMAC-SHA256/512</p>
<p>Data digest: SHA256/512</p>
<p>HUKS has the following restrictions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Secure storage of keys: Keys must be stored in a secure area and
cannot be modified. When factory settings are restored, preset keys
are not deleted.</p></li>
<li><p>Key access security: OpenHarmony stores different data of an
application separately to implement data isolation in the
application, and includes the UID and process ID in the parameter
structure to implement data isolation between different applications.</p></li>
<li><p>Concurrent access is not supported, that is, multiple applications
cannot invoke HUKS simultaneously. As HUKS is a single library,
resource exclusion is not a concern. If multiple applications need to
use HUKS, each of them needs to connect to a HUKS library and pass a
path for storing data. Data is stored in the directory of each
application.</p></li>

<h2>Device Interconnection Security<a class="headerlink" href="#device-interconnection-security" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To transmit user data securely between devices, ensure that the devices
are trusted by each other. A trust relationship and a secure data
transmission channel must be established between the devices. This
section describes how an IoT controller and IoT device establish a trust
relationship. The following figure shows how an IoT controller and an
IoT device establish a trust relationship.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>Figure 4</strong> How an IoT controller and an IoT device establish a trust
relationship</div>
<div class="line"><img alt="image4" src="../_images/how-an-iot-controller-and-an-iot-device-establish-a-trust-relationship.png" /></div>
</div>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>IoT device interconnection security</strong></p>
<p>A trust relationship can be established between an IoT device that
runs OpenHarmony (such as an AI speaker, smart home device, and
wearable) and an IoT controller. Encrypted user data is transmitted
between the IoT device and IoT controller through a secure
connection.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>IoT service identifier of the IoT controller</strong></p>
<p>An IoT controller generates different identifiers for different IoT
device management services to isolate these services. The identifier
can be used for authentication and communication between an IoT
controller and an IoT device. It is an Ed25519 public/private key
pair generated using the elliptic curve cryptography.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>IoT device identifier</strong></p>
<p>An IoT device can generate its own device identifier for
communicating with the IoT controller. It is also an Ed25519
public/private key pair generated using elliptic curve cryptography,
with the private key stored on the IoT device. Each time the device
is restored to factory settings, the public/private key pair will be
reset.</p>
<p>The identifier can be used for secure communication between the IoT
controller and IoT device. After the devices exchange the service
identifier or device identifier, they can negotiate the key and
establish a secure communication channel.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>P2P trusted binding between devices</strong></p>
<p>When an IoT controller and an IOT device establish a trust
relationship, they exchange identifiers.</p>
<p>During this process, the user needs to enter or scan the PIN provided
by the IoT device on the IoT controller. PIN is either dynamically
generated if the IoT device has a screen, or preset by the
manufacturer if it does not have a screen. A PIN can be a number or a
QR code. Then the IoT controller and IoT device perform
authentication and session key exchange based on password
authenticated key exchange (PAKE), and use the session key to encrypt
the channel for exchanging identity public keys.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Secure communication between the IoT controller and IoT device</strong></p>
<p>When an IoT controller and an IoT device communicate with each other
after establishing a trust relationship, they authenticate each other
by using the locally stored identity public key of the peer.
Bidirectional identity authentication and session key exchange are
performed using the Station-to-Station (STS) protocol during each
communication. The session key is used to encrypt the data
transmission channel between the devices.</p>

<span id="id5"></span><h2>Mechanism<a class="headerlink" href="#mechanism-3" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Application signature management</p>
<p>After developing and debugging an OpenHarmony application, sign the
application installation package using a private key, which matches a
public key. Generally, the OEM generates a public/private key pair,
presets the public key in the device, and stores the private key on a
local server that is not connected to the Internet to prevent private
key leakage. After you finish developing an application, you can use
an external device (such as a USB flash drive) to upload the
installation package to the server where the private key is stored,
calculate the signature, and download the signature to the external
device. During application installation, the hash value of the bundle
is calculated using the SHA-256 algorithm. The hash value, together
with the signature and preset public key, is used for authentication.
The application can be installed only after the authentication is
successful.</p>
<p>In addition, the application source must be verified to ensure that
the application is from a valid developer. As a developer, you must
apply for a development certificate and use it to sign the
application you have developed. During application installation, the
upper-level certificate stored on the device is used to verify the
signature to ensure validity of the developer.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Application permission control</p>
<p>OpenHarmony allows users to install third-party applications and
controls calls made by third-party applications to sensitive
permissions. When developing an application, you need to declare the
sensitive permissions that the application may invoke in the
<strong>profile.json</strong> file. The permissions include static and dynamic
ones. Static permissions need to be registered during application
installation, and dynamic permissions can be invoked only upon user
authorization. Authorization modes include system settings, manual
authorization by applications, and others. In addition, application
signature control is used to ensure that the application installation
package has been confirmed by the device vendor.</p>
