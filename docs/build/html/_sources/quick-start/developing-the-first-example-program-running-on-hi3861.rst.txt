Developing the First Example Program Running on Hi3861
======================================================

This example shows how to use attention (AT) commands to complete WLAN
module networking.

Acquiring Source Code
---------------------

You need to acquire `Hi3861 source
code <https://repo.huaweicloud.com/harmonyos/os/1.0/code-1.0.tar.gz>`__
and download it on a Linux server. For more methods, see `Source Code
Acquisition <../get-code/source-code-acquisition.md>`__.

Compiling Source Code
---------------------

This section describes how to compile the WLAN module on a Linux server.

1. Use the OpenHarmony IDE DevEco to connect to a Linux server. (The IDE
   DevEco integrates the capabilities of terminal tools. For details
   about how to use the tool, see `User
   Guide <https://device.harmonyos.com/en/docs/ide/user-guides/service_introduction-0000001050166905>`__.)

   Click **View** and then **Terminal** to start the IDE terminal tool.

   On the TERMINAL page, run the ssh command, for example, \**ssh
   *user*\ @_ipaddr_**, to connect to the Linux server.

2. Go to the root directory of the code and run the **python build.py
   wifiiot** command in the TERMINAL page to start compilation.

3. Check whether the building is successful. If yes, **BUILD SUCCESS**
   will be displayed, as shown in the following figure.

   | |image4|

4. Check whether the following files are generated in the
   **out/wifiiot** directory.

Burning Images
--------------

You can use the DevEco tool to perform the image burning of the Hi3861
WLAN module. For details about how to use the tool, see `User
Guide <https://device.harmonyos.com/en/docs/ide/user-guides/service_introduction-0000001050166905>`__.

1. Use a USB cable to connect to the Windows workstation and WLAN
   module. (Before the connection to the WLAN module, download the
   USB-to-serial driver from
   http://www.wch.cn/search?q=ch340g&t=downloads and install it.) In
   addition, query the COM port on the device manager, for example,
   CH340 (COM11) which provides functions of code burning, log printing,
   and AT commands execution.

   | |image6|

2. Enter the burning configuration page.

   **Figure 7** Basic configurations for image burning

   |image7|

3. Configure basic parameters.

   1. Set a proper baud rate. A higher baud rate indicates a faster
      burning speed. Here **921600** is recommended.
   2. Select a data bit. The default value of **Data bit** for the WLAN
      module is **8**.
   3. Select the version package path
      **./out/wifiiot/Hi3861_wifiiot_app_allinone.bin** and **Hiburn**
      mode.
   4. Click **Save** to save configurations.

4. On the DevEco, click **Burn** |image10| and select the serial port
   **COM11**.

   | **Figure 10** Starting a burning
   | |image11|

5. After the serial port is selected, **Connecting, please reset
   deviceâ€¦** is shown below the **TERMINAL** tab, indicating that the
   module is in the to-be-burnt state.

   | **Figure 11** Burning process
   | |image12|

6. Press the **Reset** key on the module to start burning. **Execution
   Successful** displayed below the **TERMINAL** tab indicates the
   burning is complete.

Connecting WLAN Module to the Internet
--------------------------------------

After completing version building and burning, do as follows to connect
the WLAN module to the Internet using AT commands.

   |image14| **NOTE:** - The DevEco serial port connection function is
   to be launched soon, so stay tuned. - In this example, the serial
   port tool IPOP is used for demonstration. You can obtain this tool
   from the Internet.

1. Use a USB cable to connect the Windows workstation to the Hi3861
   development board. Ensure that the serial port to be connected is
   **COM11**, as shown in the following figure.

   **Figure 13** COM port of the device manager

   |image15|

2. On the Windows workstation, use IPOP to connect to the serial port
   (COM11) of the WLAN module, set the baud rate to **115200**, select
   **Newline**, and ensure that the entered string ends with **\\r\n**
   to avoid AT command input failures.

   **Figure 14** IPOP connection configuration

   |image16|

3. Reset the WLAN module. The message **ready to OS start** is displayed
   on the terminal page, indicating that the WLAN module is started
   successfully.

4. Run the following AT commands in sequence via the IPOP serial
   terminal to start the STA mode, connect to the specified AP, and
   enable Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).

   ::

      AT+STARTSTA                             - Start the STA mode.
      AT+SCAN                                 - Scan for available APs.
      AT+SCANRESULT                           - Display the scanning result.
      AT+CONN="SSID",,2,"PASSWORD"            - Connect to the specified AP. (SSID and PASSWORD represent the name and password of the hotspot to be connected, respectively.)
      AT+STASTAT                              - View the connection result.
      AT+DHCP=wlan0,1                         - Request the IP address of wlan0 from the AP using DHCP.

5. Check whether the WLAN module is properly connected to the gateway,
   as shown in the following figure.

   ::

      AT+IFCFG                                - View the IP address assigned to an interface of the module.
      AT+PING=X.X.X.X                         - Check the connectivity between the module and the gateway. Replace X.X.X.X with the actual gateway address.
