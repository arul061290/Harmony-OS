<h2>Mechanism<a class="headerlink" href="#mechanism" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Process isolation</p>
<p>Process isolation prevents processes from reading and writing memory
data of each other. Generally, virtual address space mapping is used
for process isolation. The virtual addresses of two processes are
mapped to physical address segments using the memory management unit
(MMU). In this way, the non-shared memory data that can be accessed
by one of the two processes through the virtual address is
inaccessible to the other process.</p>
<p>Due to limited resources, OpenHarmony adopts different mechanisms for
kernel-level and user-level processes. All kernel-level processes
share the same VMM space, that is, kernel-level processes are not
isolated from each other. When the OS is booted, two basic
kernel-level processes KProcess and KIdle are created. KProcess is
the root process of kernel-level process, and KIdle is the subprocess
of KProcess. Each user-level process has its own VMM space that is
invisible to other processes, and user-level processes are isolated
from each other.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Discretionary access control</p>
<p>Discretionary access control (DAC) means that the file owner
determines access permissions of other roles from three dimensions:
user, group, and other. The file owner can classify any user into one
of the three dimensions and adopt a control policy to perform DAC
permission verification. Each application has a UID. When creating a
file, an application adds its UID to the metadata of the file and
sets permissions of the user, group, and other. When an application
tries to access the file, the UID and permissions in the metadata of
the file are used to verify the application UID. DAC depends on the
attributes of processes, such as the UID and GID, which are used as
feature IDs during file creation and access. When creating a file,
the creator writes its UID into the file. When a file is accessed,
the UID is used for classifying the file.</p>
<p>The following figure shows how DAC works when a process accesses a
file. The DAC first matches the process UID with the file UID, and
then the process GID with the file GID. If the UID and GID both fail
to match, DAC checks the <strong>other</strong> attribute of the file to determine
whether the process is allowed to read, write, or execute the file.
In addition, the system supports a privileged capability that is not
subject to DAC mechanism and can access files directly. Services with
high permissions (such as system services) can manage files of
applications with low permissions (such as third-party applications).</p>

</li>
<li><p>Capability mechanism</p>
<p>The capability mechanism is a subdivision of the root permission. A
multi-user computer system usually has a special role that has all
system permissions, that is, the system administrator with the root
permission. OpenHarmony needs to support kernels of the third-party
application ecosystem, and privileged access to the system must be
controlled. The system needs to restrict privileged system calls made
by users to access the kernel. Only some applications with high-level
permissions are allowed to perform privileged operations. To be
specific, the kernel spawns the first user program INIT that has all
privileged permissions. Then INIT starts other application framework
services and retains only privileged permissions necessary for each
application. When an application requests to call a privileged API,
the kernel checks whether the application has the permission to
access the API based on the process ID.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Secure boot</p>
<p>Secure boot is the basis of system security. A digital signature and
integrity verification mechanism is used to verify the integrity and
validity of software at each layer, starting from the boot root of
trust in the chip. This ensures that a correct and valid OS is
booted, preventing attackers from tampering with or implanting system
software and providing a secure, basic running environment.</p>
<p>The chip does not need to be verified after it is powered on because
the on-chip ROM code cannot be modified. The on-chip ROM verifies the
bootloader based on the public key hash value which is calculated
using the asymmetric algorithm in eFuse. The verification is
performed based on the hardware trust root and is fully trusted. The
bootloader that passes this verification is deemed to be trusted for
subsequent use. This is the process of constructing a trust chain.
Bootloader initializes the execution environment, including
initializing the double data rate (DDR) and reading and writing the
flash memory, to prepare for loading modules and executing more
complex logic. After the bootloader is initialized, it verifies the
integrity of the X.509 certificate and verifies image packages
(<strong>kernel.bin</strong>, <strong>teeOS.bin</strong>, and <strong>rootfs.bin</strong>) using the public
key of the X.509 certificate.</p>

<h2>Recommended Practices<a class="headerlink" href="#recommended-practices" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>DAC and the capability mechanism are used to control who can access
resources. It is recommended that the minimum permissions are
granted.</p></li>
<li><p>Secure boot must be enabled, and the trusted root must be in the chip
and cannot be modified. In addition, you must consider the impact of
secure upgrade (if available) on secure boot, that is, the signature
or hash value of an image file must be updated after a secure
upgrade.</p></li>
