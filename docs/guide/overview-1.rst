Overview
========

This document describes how to use the IoT camera development board and
the built-in camera and screen of the development kit to implement
photographing, video recording, and video preview.

You can perform operations provided in `Use Case <use-case-5.md>`__ to
learn more about development board peripheral control and then develop
devices, such as peephole cameras, smart rear-view mirrors, and smart
displays.

If you want to view the sample effect first, see `Use
Case <use-case-5.md>`__. To customize application behavior, modify the
sample code by referring to APIs described in `Development
Guidelines <development-guidelines-2.md>`__.

For details about basic concepts for camera development, see the `camera
development overview <../subsystems/overview.md>`__.
